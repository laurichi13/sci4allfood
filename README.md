# Sci4AllFood
Repository of the project "Citizensâ€™ food-related daily problem solving by engaging multidisciplinary scientific communities"


## ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Sci4AllFood project!!

We are happy to welcome everybody to collaborate in this project.

### Vision statement

We will work with other scientists to fix common food problems for people in Madrid. We will provide tools to connect peoplewith scientists, where citizens will expose their issues with food and nutrition. Scientists will create specific open projects and will work in collaboration to help solve these problems. We are working open because we think transparency is the key to connect Science with the society.
